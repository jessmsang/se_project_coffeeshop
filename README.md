# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

1. Spacing changes: I would personally like to make the pages feel slightly more balanced by adjusting the margins/padding/gaps between elements. More specifically, I feel that the "Recipes", "Menu", "About", and "Footer" pages need some spacing adjustments.
2. More animations: I would add the circle pulsating animation to each page, but on differing corners to maximize the balance on each page (except for the header page, since it feels full already).
3. More user convenience: I would add a "back to top" button that is fixed and visible at all times.
4. More user interaction: I would add a :hover pseudo-element to the youtube videos to change the opacity.
5. Nav bar: I would change the "contacts" nav title to "about", since that feels more appropriate for the page's content.
6. Hours and address: I would also add these to the bottom of the "About" page.
