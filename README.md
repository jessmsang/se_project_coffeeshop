# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

There are some spacing changes I would personally make to make the pages feel slightly more balanced. More specifically, the "Recipes", "Menu", "About", and "Footer" pages.

I would also add the circle pulsating animation to each page, but alternating which top corner it appears on (except for the header page, since it feels full already).
